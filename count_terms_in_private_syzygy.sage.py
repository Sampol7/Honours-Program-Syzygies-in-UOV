_sage_const_7 = Integer(7); _sage_const_3 = Integer(3); _sage_const_4 = Integer(4); _sage_const_1 = Integer(1)# Step 1: Define the field k and the number of variables and polynomials
k = GF(_sage_const_7 )  # For example, finite field of size 7
m = _sage_const_3       # Number of linear and quadratic polynomials
n = _sage_const_4       # Number of variables

# Step 2: Define the polynomial ring R over the field k with n variables
R = PolynomialRing(k, 'x', n)
x = R.gens()  # The variables x0, x1, ..., xn-1

# Step 3: Create m random linear homogeneous polynomials L_i with coefficients in k
L = [sum(k.random_element() * x[i] for i in range(n)) for _ in range(m)]

# Step 4: Define m homogeneous quadratic polynomials Q_i with indeterminate coefficients
Q_coeffs = var([f'b_{i}_{j}' for i in range(n) for j in range(i, n)])  # Quadratic indeterminates
Q = [sum(Q_coeffs[i*n + j] * x[i] * x[j] for i in range(n) for j in range(i, n)) for _ in range(m)]

# Step 5: Set up the equation L1*Q1 + L2*Q2 + ... + Lm*Qm = 0
equation = sum(L[i] * Q[i] for i in range(m))

# Step 6: Extract the coefficients of monomials from the expanded equation
expanded_equation = equation.expand()
monomials = expanded_equation.monomials()  # Get monomials of degree <= 3
coefficients = [expanded_equation.monomial_coefficient(m) for m in monomials]

# Step 7: Construct the matrix M of the linear system
# M will have rows corresponding to the monomials and columns corresponding to the Q_coeffs
M = matrix(k, len(monomials), len(Q_coeffs))

# Fill in the matrix M
for i, monomial in enumerate(monomials):
    for j, q_var in enumerate(Q_coeffs):
        M[i, j] = expanded_equation.coefficient({q_var: _sage_const_1 , monomial: _sage_const_1 })  # Fill with coefficients

# Step 8: Compute the rank of the matrix M
matrix_rank = M.rank()

# Output the matrix M and its rank
print("Matrix M:")
print(M)
